== How to run

You can choose to the Spring Boot CLi version of this sample:

. Install Spring Boot CLI
. spring jar app.jar sample.groovy && java -jar app.jar 
. In another shell, use curl to interrogate the service

Or you can check out the Spring Boot Java-based version:

. mvn clean spring-boot:run

Either of these options will let you poke around with a simple example of Spring Data REST.
